// Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

// The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

// on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
// except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
// unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
// For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

// If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.
function leapYear(year) {
  // most specific to least
  if (year % 400 === 0) {
    return true;
  } else if (year % 100 === 0) {
    return false;
  } else if (year % 4 === 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(leapYear(1997)); // false
console.log(leapYear(1996)); // true
console.log(leapYear(1900)); // false
console.log(leapYear(2000)); // true
